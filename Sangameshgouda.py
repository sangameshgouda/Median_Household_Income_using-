# Observation:
# Rate of Unemployment:
# Look into states with either high or low unemployment rates, considering regional similarities in neighboring states. Take into account factors like industries present, government policies, and recent events that could influence these rates.
# 
# Average Income
# Given that regional differences exist in the cost of living, the states with the greatest and lowest median salaries might not accurately represent the real purchasing power of their citizens. Therefore, while analyzing the financial well-being of people in other states, it's critical to take into account both income levels and the cost of living.
# 
# Comparing the unemployment rate and median income across states reveals that higher median incomes don't always correlate with lower unemployment rates, and vice versa. Analyzing these variables helps understand economic conditions and regional disparities within the country.

# Notes:
# [1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
# R-squared Value (0.047): This figure shows that the unemployment rate barely accounts for 4.7% of the variation in median family income. This indicates that the two variables in the dataset have a comparatively weak linear connection.
# 
# The unemployment rate coefficient (-1760.2) is: Given that the coefficient is negative, it may be concluded that the median household income tends to decline as the unemployment rate rises. In particular, the median family income is predicted to fall by around $1760 for every 1 % increase in the unemployment rate.
# 
# P-value (< 0.0001) for the Unemployment Rate Coefficient: The p-value is very lowâ€”much lower than the typical significance threshold of 0.05. This suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between the unemployment rate and median household income, and it is highly unlikely that this impact would have been seen by coincidence.
# 
# 
# Model Fit Statistics: The model appears to be statistically significant overall based on the F-statistic (160.8) and the corresponding p-value (5.23e-36).
# 
# Diagnostic Statistics: The residuals may have some positive autocorrelation, although it's not very strong, according to the Durbin-Watson statistic (1.353). The residuals show departures from normalcy according to the Jarque-Bera and Omnibus tests, indicating the existence of skewness and kurtosis. This may have an impact on the validity of the significance tests and standard errors, and it may call for more research or different modeling strategies.

# Plot of Residuals against Unemployment Rate
# Distribution of Residuals:
# At lower unemployment rate numbers in particular, it appears that the residuals are not distributed equally around the zero line.Apparent rise in residual variance with rising unemployment rates.
# 
# Outliers and Patterns: There is a clear trend: as the unemployment rate rises, residuals become more dispersed. A few extreme numbers are also included; they might be significant points or outliers.
# 
# Q-Q Plot
# Deviation from Normality: The residuals are not normally distributed if the points in the Normal Q-Q plot (bottom right plot), especially at the ends, do not lie on the diagonal line.
# 
# Skewness: The Normal Q-Q plot's curve indicates that the residual distribution may have heavy tails, as well as skewness.
# 
# Conclusion of our analysis on Unemployment2021
# our analysis of the "Unemployment2021" dataset involved loading the data, conducting a full exploratory data analysis, and prepared the dataset by locating and addressing possible outliers and missing values .
# 
# Though the relatively low R-squared value indicated that unemployment rates alone do not substantially predict median household income, we did find a statistically significant negative association between unemployment rates and median household income.
# 
# Potential problems with the regression model, such as non-normality of residuals, were discovered through additional research using diagnostic plots. These problems imply that some of the assumptions of the linear regression model were not met, which may have an impact on the validity of inferential statistics as well as the predictability of the model's predictions

# Intereface:
# 
# 
# 
# Economic policies, industry placements, educational attainment, and resource accessibility are just a few of the many factors that can influence changes in economic indices like the median family income and unemployment rate. The maps clearly show the regional variations that exist throughout the United States.
# 
# High median income and low unemployment rates do not consistently correlate across all states, suggesting that other factors may be influencing both measures.
# 
# When interpreting these maps, it's critical to consider the larger socioeconomic backdrop. For instance, states with high median income may also have high cost of living, as the graph does not make explicit.
